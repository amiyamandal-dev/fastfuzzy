# FastFuzzy Examples - Project Summary

## Overview

This project contains practical examples demonstrating various use cases for the fastfuzzy library, a high-performance fuzzy string matching library implemented in Rust with Python bindings.

## Examples Created

1. **Basic Fuzzy Matcher Demo** (`fuzzy_matcher_demo.py`)
   - Demonstrates core fuzzy matching capabilities
   - Shows basic string similarity functions
   - Illustrates fuzzy search in lists
   - Provides batch processing examples

2. **Data Deduplication** (`data_deduplication.py`)
   - Shows how to use fuzzy matching for identifying and removing duplicate records
   - Demonstrates record similarity calculation
   - Implements duplicate detection and clustering

3. **Spell Checker** (`spell_checker.py`)
   - Implementation of a spell checker using fuzzy matching
   - Provides word validation and spelling corrections
   - Shows text checking and sentence suggestions

4. **Fuzzy API Service** (`fuzzy_api_service.py`)
   - Web API service built with FastAPI for fuzzy matching operations
   - Provides RESTful endpoints for similarity calculations
   - Includes batch processing and fuzzy search APIs

5. **Log Analysis** (`log_analysis.py`)
   - Log analysis tool using fuzzy matching to identify patterns
   - Groups similar log messages
   - Identifies frequent patterns and anomalies

## Current Status

The examples have been created and demonstrate various use cases for fuzzy string matching. However, there is a segmentation fault issue in the fastfuzzy library that prevents the examples from running successfully.

### Issue Details

When attempting to run any example that uses the fastfuzzy library, a segmentation fault (exit code 139) occurs. This indicates a memory access violation in the underlying Rust code.

The issue likely stems from one of the following:
1. Memory management problems in the Rust implementation
2. Incorrect usage of PyO3 bindings
3. Concurrency issues with the parallel processing implementation
4. Problems with the caching mechanisms

### Potential Solutions

1. **Debug the Rust code** - Use debugging tools to identify where the segmentation fault occurs
2. **Simplify the implementation** - Create a minimal version to isolate the issue
3. **Check PyO3 documentation** - Ensure proper usage of Python bindings
4. **Review memory management** - Check for issues with unsafe code or incorrect memory handling

## Installation and Usage

To use these examples (once the library issues are resolved):

1. Build the fastfuzzy library:
   ```bash
   pip install maturin
   maturin develop --release
   ```

2. Install additional dependencies for examples:
   ```bash
   pip install fastapi uvicorn
   ```

3. Run any example:
   ```bash
   python examples/fuzzy_matcher_demo.py
   ```

## Value of Examples

These examples demonstrate practical applications of fuzzy string matching:

1. **Data Cleaning** - Remove duplicates from customer databases
2. **Log Analysis** - Group similar error messages for better monitoring
3. **Spell Checking** - Provide intelligent spelling corrections
4. **Search Enhancement** - Improve search results with fuzzy matching
5. **Record Linkage** - Match records across different databases

The examples are designed to be easily customizable for specific use cases and provide a foundation for building more complex fuzzy matching applications.
